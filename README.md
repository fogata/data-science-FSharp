## Overview

This repository provides hands-on examples of data science techniques and concepts in F#. Each example highlights different facets of data analysis, from data preparation to machine learning. F#’s functional programming approach makes it a great fit for data science workflows, allowing for clean, readable, and maintainable code.

## Why F# for Data Science?

F# is known for its functional-first design, immutability, and powerful type inference, which simplify data transformations and analysis. Features such as **pipelining**, **pattern matching**, and **async workflows** make F# a compelling choice for building reliable data science applications.
